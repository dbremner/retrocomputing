.SH NAME
stdconv -- convert source to IEEE Std 1154-1991 PILOT
.SH SYNOPSIS
stdconv
.SH DESCRIPTION
This program does some conformance checking for IEEE PILOT, and
attempts to convert source from certain other dialects to be
compatible with the IEEE reference implementation.
.PP
At the moment, the only outright conversion it does is from the
postfix-$ form of string identifier used in Capitol Pilot to prefix-form.
.PP
It also checks for certain nonstandard keywords and complains if
they're found.  These include: CA: (cursor address), FOOT: (go to foot
of screen), V: (video), S: (sound), X: (execute indirect), D:
(dimension) and W: (wait).
.PP
The program to be converted and checked is read from standard input,
and the converted form written to stdout.  Warnings and error messages
are written to standard error and should be self-explanatory.
.SH NOTE
For a better (but slower) conformance test, compile the program using
pilot's -c option.  For a much stricter test, disallowing extensions
present in the this reference implentation but not described in the
standard, add the -p (pedantic) option.
