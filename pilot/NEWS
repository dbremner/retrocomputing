				TO DO

1. Full dynamic-memory management; no more fixed string-length limits.

2. File handling.  There's no standard FILE syntax, but there are some
   conventions common in existing versions.

3. Interpreter support for X (Execute)?  Not hard to con the lexer
   into taking characters from a string, but we'd have to go to Bison or
   some other method that generates re-entrant parsers.
