   Greetings, Eric.

   My office partner will send the JOSS implementation from his home
   machine.  (He is Kevin Brown, says he met you a while ago at a party.)

   I looked over the source listing for the first time in a while.
   I'm afraid I have no documentation.

   A few minor alterations to the language:

   (a)  I replaced the standard JOSS error message of "Eh?" with
        more specific error messages.

   (b)  The JOSS forms (____.__ for fixed point, ....... for exponential)
        were replaced by C-format strings like "answer = %d".

   (c)  The JOSS looping construct:

           Do ... for i = 3(1)7

        is harder to parse when you have functions; for example

           for i = a(b)(c)
           for i = a(b)(c)(d)

        are both legal but very different meanings.  So I used angle
        brackets:  for i = 3<1>7 

        A less lazy person might alter the parser to read the () instead.

   I don't have a lot of time to work on this, but is there anything I/we
   can do to prepare it for the hallowed halls of the Retro Museum?

   -- Thanks,
      Bob Mayans
